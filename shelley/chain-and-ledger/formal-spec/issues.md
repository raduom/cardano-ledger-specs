Questions and Outstanding Issues


1. Should I go ahead with native multicurrency and NFT support?

- Fees will be paid in Ada only

- Review how best to express the general
accounting property

2. Should the reward calculation take into account *only* Ada tokens
associated with staking credentials? This also includes pool pledges,
parameters, and anything else to do with rewards, etc. Essentially,
the only place other tokens should appear are in the general accounting
property, transaction inputs and outputs, and UTxO.

3. To avoid more than one copy of the validator, there is a hash lookup
Map in the transaction. Should we do this also for the redeemer and data?
Since these are smaller (perhaps smaller than their own hashes), this
may not be a good idea?

4. Staking rights for Plutus scripts (what to do about data scripts?)

3. More specific typechecking and script validation functions still need to be added
to this spec.

4. The cost model calculation - is the approach correct here in terms of the
abstract types used? Is this the model we want to plug in real types into
later? I.e. the CostMod in protocol parameters and the ExUnits in the transactions.

3. Is there anything else that should only happen if all scripts have validated
(so far, it is UTxO update with inputs and outputs, and reward withdrawals)?

9. Clean up the script arguments (not pass unneeded ones).

10. Is there any concern about the `forged` field containing negative values?

- Is `forged` on the correct value preservation equation side?

- Should we have `forged` and `unforged`?

11. If there is a certificate witnessed by a Plutus script which does not validate,
we scrap everything about that transaction except taking the script fees?

13. Nothing should happen if _any_ script fails to validate except that
the fees-market inputs are removed from the UTxO and their sum total
goes to fees
- No delegation things
- No update proposals
- No deposits or refunds
- We do not take the `txfee` (do not force the user to include it in the
  fee-marked inputs)

12. The empty sequence LEDGERS rule is ok, right? Even in the case of
script validation failure? There are no other rules firing with this
specific transaction in the environment or signal?

14. Is there a better way to express `adaAll`

15. Note the type change of `PendingTxInS`

16. Any problem with possibly having extra validators in the Vals map?

17. Is it useful to expose transaction metadata to scripts?

13. Do Plutus scripts need access to other things like delegation state, etc.?

5. Data scripts not stored in the UTxO at all, but supplied by both the
party paying into the script and the one spending. Hash is computed on-chain
and stored with the UTxO entry.

6. Validation, data script and redeemer script size constraints.

7. In case we decide to require deposits for storing data scripts on-chain:

- Not immediately clear how collecting the DS deposits would work:
Deposits have to go back to whoever originally paid into the script.
Transaction spending the data script, and thus triggering a refund,
does not have access to this info.

- Could store the refund address alongside DS and make a UTxO entry
that way

- Might prefer a separate pool for these types of deposits (because of
PP changes affecting refunds etc. from the certificate pool, recalculating
obligation).

- Should these types of deposits decay (differently than other deposits)?

8. Random seed from consensus layer

- Decided this is not necessary and will disturb deterministic behaviour

9. Data that makes up PendingTx:

- are there any changes coming here?
